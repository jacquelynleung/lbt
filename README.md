Local Business tracker showcases businesses that are in the user's current area. The application will highlight people of color owned businesses and businesses that were hurt during Covid-19, using categories such as grocery, entertainment, clothing, and services. 
Users will be able to employ our minimalist application to search their local area and give ratings on how well the establishment adheres to Covid-19 practices. 
Business owners will be able to list their establishments and address customer ratings.

Features:
So far our beta allows users to login/sign up and search for a business. While the possible search parameters are currently limited, users are allowed to search for a business and view the results of there search. The review feature is also available for users to test. In our beta users will be able to type a review about a business they find from 
their search.

Defects:
Since this is only a beta there are numerous features that are not fully implememted. The catagory buttons are currently limited so using the catagories may not be an option.
While we do have a covid tab at the top of the page, the covid page is currently not upload and therefore does not work. The catagories button does not work as well, so while it appears at the top of the page users will be unable to view the catagories. Users can sign up and login to our application however, the name of the user will not be displayed.
Instead a placeholder name "user123" will be displayed instead. Our application is very minimal at the moment so the styling of the pages may be simple and awkward. 
Finally, while a user can type in a reivew for a business the submit button does not work so they will be unable to post it.

-Covid page is not uploaded
-Category button does not work
-Sign up login only goes to user123
-Styling on the pages is minimal and awkward
-Submit review does not work
